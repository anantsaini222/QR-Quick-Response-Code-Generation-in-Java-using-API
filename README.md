# QR-Quick-Response-Code-Generation-in-Java-using-API

This is the QR Code Creation Project in which you'll have to import one package called "qrgen-1.0" and it's two library's also called as "zxing-core-1.7" and "zxing-j2se-1.7".

So these library will help your java Application to understand the methods you creating and will allow you to enter the Information you want to add along the Location where you want to create your QR Code.


Also i'm attaching all the pacakage and the library file along with the example of my QR Code also the image of the message it will pop when you'll scan it by same 3rd party application.
